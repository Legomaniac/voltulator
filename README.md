# Voltulator
Flask webapp for calculating monthly charging costs for the Chevy Volt
----

The CSV files available from http:/myvolt.com display accurate kWh charge records for the last 30 days. Using this tool, those CSV files can be uploaded, and a per charge cost and total cost for the last 30 days can be determined.

This can be useful if you have roommates that you split the electricity bill with that likely do not want to pay for your driving.
